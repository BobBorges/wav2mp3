# Wav2mp3

I have some music in `wav` files. These files are good quality but take up a lot of space, so this is a program to batch-convert `wav` files in a folder to mp3...

## Usage

Clone repo and make a bash alias to the shell script. Call the alias with a directory as a single argument

`wav2mp3 "folder with wav files/"`

it will create a "folder with wav files/em-pee-three/" directory and all the wav files will appear there in mp3 versions.
